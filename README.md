# Backtracking Sudoku Solver
Basic backtracking algorithm used to recursively solve a Sudoku board. 

The program will check for empty cells try all possible numbers until a valid play is made. If a valid play is no longer possible it will backtrack, resetting the previous cell and trying a different number.

The input board can be changed by editing it inside the project file.
